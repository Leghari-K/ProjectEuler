Playing around Project Euler Problems to keep some fresh blood flowing towards my brain :)

Nothing fancy, I'm not that good in Math. Brute force and all that. If it gets solved with-in 3 minutes on my Intel i7 machine, I'll accept solution regardless of how good or bad the code is.

My goal is to solve them all some day. Just for fun of it.



I'm using Eclipse/OpenJDK 17 on a Windows 11 i7 box.
